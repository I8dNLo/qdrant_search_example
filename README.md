**Advertisement Image Dataset Search Tool**
=============
Welcome to the Advertisement Image Dataset Search Tool! This tool allows you to search through a dataset of advertisement images using text prompts. The service leverages the VIT-CLIP model to embed both images and prompts into the same vector space, enabling efficient and accurate searching. The embedded images are stored in a Qdrant database, providing fast retrieval.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Advertisement Image Dataset Search Tool, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
https://github.com/I8dNLo/qdrant_search_example.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:


```cd advertisement-image-search-tool```

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

Run the following command to start the service:


```docker-compose up```

Usage
Once the service is up and running, you can access the search tool through your web browser at http://localhost:7860. The frontend interface allows you to enter text prompts to search through the advertisement image dataset.

## Components
The Advertisement Image Dataset Search Tool consists of the following components:

* **VIT-CLIP Model**: This model is used to embed both images and text prompts into the same vector space.

* **Qdrant Database**: The embedded images are stored in a Qdrant database, providing efficient retrieval for search queries.

* **Fill Database Script**: This script loads the initial vector database with the embedded image data.

* **Frontend Service**: The frontend service provides a user-friendly interface for searching through the dataset using text prompts. Gradio is used as an alternative interface.

## Example queries to try
Queries with good results:
1. "Coffee"
2. "Burger"
3. "Pizza"
4. ...
5. Literally anything which can me agressively and straight-forwardly advertized

Queries with bad results:
1. "Black cat"
2. "Starship"
3. "Coffin"
4. Or any other non-popular image for advertisment
